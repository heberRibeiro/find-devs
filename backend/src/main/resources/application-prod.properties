# Heroku will be deployed and it is responsible for executing the containers. 
# This means that Heroku will define which door will be "opened" to make it accessible from the outside. 
# This port is given by the $ PORT environment variable that will be defined when executing our image. 
# In this way, we define "server.port" for the environment variable defined by Heroku - $ PORT - 
# or the default port of the TomCat server that comes up with Spring Boot which is 8080.
